# Notes from this course
I learned about how we can use git to resolve conflicts and maintain steady version control. I think it is very convenient that we have a tool such as git.
[Link to other Markdown file](README.md)
I also figured out how to make links to other markdown files with a relative path.


From the domains assignment, I figured out how to secure a domain and how to get simple routing done with caddy. In honest reflection, I realize that it is much easier than I thought. I figured out that I needed to update the record before doing anything else.

## HTML Inputs
I loved learning the different elemnts of HTML and their function. I honestly already knew a bunch of them but it is cool to finally learn the right names for some of the elements because I have been searching forever for them. 

## HTML Media
For this assignment I figured out the ease by which I can render elements in a page.

## HTML  Structure
I learned the basic formatting of HTML elements. The assignment would have been a little easier had I used a fully fledged HTML editor with features and what not. I want to figure out how to best use the `<div>` elements for creating space in the app that I build. 

## CSS
Today I learned how CSS can be useful for all sorts of styling and animation needs. I think it is aweosome how Firefox and Chrome have CSS and HTML developer tools to aid in making a site look different.

## HTML Startup
I loved how I leaned how to structure the site decently well and get it to work. I think so far this has been pretty easy. A little bit of difficulty uploading the html files but it came along!

## CSS Startup
I learned today that CSS is a lot easier than I imagined and that window sizing can be made super simple by remembering to keep the design simple. I thnik it is really great that one can create a very good looking website with properly crafted CSS and if it can be reusesd, the better. 

## Fetch
Something that is interesting about javascript is how it transformed the web into a place where apps could be made. It seems that the trend today with web apps is that they are pretty futre-proofed systems that have been tried and tested.
