Startup application for CS 260 BYU

## Elevator Pitch
I am creating a simple stock analysis app. I will allow users to add API's and visualize them alongside their realtime stock data. It will allow for preferences to be saved on their own user accounts, and view multiple charts.

## Basic overview of the idea
Image goes here

How I will use each technology

- HTML: For structuring the application menus, navigation, and page structure do isplay the graphics and images of the service.
- CSS: To add style and elegance to the app to allow it to be more user friendly and easy to use.
- JavaScript: to animate elements on the page, show key indicators, allow for interactive features and scrolling? and more.
- Call web services: I will use JavaScript to make HTTPS requests to API's that provide information about the stock price and key indicators.
- Provide web services:
- Authentication: I will allow users to create accounts (more on that in the next item) and allow them to use the JWT library to allow for token-based user authentication. 
- Storage: creates and stores records of user's personal preferences for their stock market views and services.
- WebSockets: will allow the server to update the client-side data whenever the stock price or indicator changes.
